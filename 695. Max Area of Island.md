## Problem
You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return _the maximum **area** of an island in_ `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/maxarea1-grid.jpg)

**Input:** grid = [ [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0] ]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** grid = [ [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] ]
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

## My Solution
I applied a graph algorithm solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        max_area = 0

        def dfs(r, c):
            area = 0
            q = deque()
            q.append((r, c))
            grid[r][c] = 0

            while q:
                area += 1
                row, col = q.popleft()
                directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]]

                for dr, dc in directions:
                    r, c = row + dr, col + dc
                    if (
                        r in range(rows)
                        and c in range(cols)
                        and grid[r][c] == 1
                    ):
                        q.append((r, c))
                        grid[r][c] = 0

            return area

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    area = dfs(r, c)
                    max_area = max(max_area, area)

        return max_area
```

 The top solutions also use the same code as me, so i am not worried about the result
