## Problem
You are given an integer array `nums`. You need to ensure that the elements in the array are **distinct**. To achieve this, you can perform the following operation any number of times:
- Remove 3 elements from the beginning of the array. If the array has fewer than 3 elements, remove all remaining elements.

**Note** that an empty array is considered to have distinct elements. Return the **minimum** number of operations needed to make the elements in the array distinct.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,2,3,3,5,7]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:**
- In the first operation, the first 3 elements are removed, resulting in the array `[4, 2, 3, 3, 5, 7]`.
- In the second operation, the next 3 elements are removed, resulting in the array `[3, 5, 7]`, which has distinct elements.

Therefore, the answer is 2.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** nums = [4,5,6,4,4]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:**
- In the first operation, the first 3 elements are removed, resulting in the array `[4, 4]`.
- In the second operation, all remaining elements are removed, resulting in an empty array.

Therefore, the answer is 2.

**Example 3:**
**Input:** nums = [6,7,8,9]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:**
The array already contains distinct elements. Therefore, the answer is 0.


**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## My Solution
### Line of Thought
We need to check if the in the current list there is a repeated number, if there is we take out the first three numbers, if there is not a repeated number, we return the number of operations.

One way we can do this in python is to add the array to a `set` and check if the length of both is equal, if not, we take out the first three elements and add one to the count of operations.

```python
def minimumOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
	count = 0
	
	while len(nums) >= 0:
		a = set(nums)
		if len(a) == len(nums):
			return count
		
		count += 1
		nums = nums[3:]
	
	return count
```

Another way would be to count how many different numbers are starting from the right, and then check how many operations we would need to do to cover it, we will cover that in the optimized solution.

## Optimized Solution
### Greedy
- In this approach we traverse in the array from its **back** and detect the **first point where a duplicate appears**.
- We then calculate the **minimal number of operations** of removal of 3 elements from the start that are needed to remove all elements up to that point.
- To calculate the **minimal number of operations** we use the formula `(i + 3) / 3`, the proof of which is given below.
- **Time Complexity :** `O(n)`.
- **Space Complexity :** `O(101)`.

- **For Example →** For the array `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5]`,
- So as mentioned in the code let's start traversing from the back of the array,

![[Pasted image 20250408095443.png]]

- Now as we've hit a duplicate we **stop our iteration** at `i = 1`.
- The total operations required are `(i + 3) / 3` or `(1 + 3) / 3` = 1.
- And as you can observe yourself we only need one operation of deletions to **reach the first duplicate**, that is `2`.

```python
class Solution: 
	def minimumOperations(self, nums): 
		mpp = [0] * 101 
		for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1): 
			mpp[nums[i]] += 1 
			if mpp[nums[i]] == 2: 
				return (i + 3) // 3 
				
		return 0
```

> [!NOTE] Note
> We could do the same with a map of booleans, but we would need to check first if the value in that position is already `True`.
