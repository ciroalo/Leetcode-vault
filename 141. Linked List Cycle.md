## Problem
Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

**Input:** head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

**Example 2:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

**Input:** head = [1,2], pos = 0
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

**Example 3:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

**Input:** head = [1], pos = -1
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Constraints:**
- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
- `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

## My Solution
My solution is not very efficient. I just inserterd into a list every node and while iterating through the linked list i check if the node is already in the list. If it is it returns `True` and `False` if it reachs the end and has not found a cycle.

```python
class Solution:
	def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
		visited = set()
		node = head
		  
		while node:
			if node in visited:
				return True
			visited.add(node)
			node = node.next
		
		return False
```

## Most Effective Solution
To determine if a singly-linked list contains a cycle, you can use **Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm**, also known as the **tortoise and hare algorithm**. The idea is to use two pointers:

- **Slow pointer**: moves one step at a time.
- **Fast pointer**: moves two steps at a time.

If there’s a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually "lap" the slow pointer and they will meet inside the cycle. If the list has no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list (null).

This works regardless of the cycle’s length or how far it is from the head, because the fast and slow pointers will eventually synchronize at some multiple of the cycle’s length. The algorithm is efficient, with **O(n)** time complexity and **O(1)** space.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
# def __init__(self, x):
# self.val = x
# self.next = None
class Solution:
	def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
		fast = slow = head
		  
		while fast and fast.next:
			slow = slow.next
			fast = fast.next.next
			  
			if fast == slow:
				return True
		
		return False
```
