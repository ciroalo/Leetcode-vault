## Problem
You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

**Example 2:**
**Input:** coins = [2], amount = 3
**Output:** -1

**Example 3:**
**Input:** coins = [1], amount = 0
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1`
- `0 <= amount <= 104`

## My Solution
For this solution I used a dynamic programming approach. 

For that first I have to check the first base case that the amount is zero, if it is the return value is zero.

After that I proceed to clean the `coins` array for coins that are bigger than the amount, because we don't have no use for those.

Then comes the creation of the `dp` array, that for each position will hold the minimum amount of coins to reach that `index`. It is first all initialised to `-1`.

Then we iterate from the first next value of coins to the target amount. Then we iterate through the coins, and check for `index` where index is `i - coin`. That way we need to check if `index > 0 and dp[index]. != -1`. If that is true, we update the value of `dp[i]` in the following manner:

```python
if dp[i] == -1:
	dp[i] = dp[index] + 1

dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[index] + 1)
```

And at the end we return `dp[amount]`.

```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        if amount == 0:
            return 0

        coins.sort()
        if coins[0] > amount:
            return -1
        for i in range(len(coins)):
            print(coins[i])
            if amount < coins[i]:
                coins = coins[:i]
                break
        
        dp = [-1] * (amount + 1)
        for coin in coins:
            dp[coin] = 1

        for i in range(coins[0] + 1, amount + 1):
            for coin in coins:
                index = i - coin
                if index > 0 and dp[index] != -1:
                    if dp[i] == -1:
                        dp[i] = dp[index] + 1
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[index] + 1)

        return dp[amount]
```

## Cleaner version

```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        dp = [amount + 1] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 0

        coins.sort()
        for i in range(len(coins)):
            if amount < coins[i]:
                coins = coins[:i]
                break

        for i in range(1, amount + 1):
            for c in coins:
                if i - c >= 0:
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-c] + 1)

        return dp[-1] if dp[-1] != amount + 1 else -1
```
