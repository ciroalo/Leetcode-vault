## Problem
Given an array of integers `temperatures` represents the daily temperatures, return _an array_ `answer` _such that_ `answer[i]` _is the number of days you have to wait after the_ `ith` _day to get a warmer temperature_. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep `answer[i] == 0` instead.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
**Output:** [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]

**Example 2:**
**Input:** temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
**Output:** [1,1,1,0]

**Example 3:**
**Input:** temperatures = [30,60,90]
**Output:** [1,1,0]

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= temperatures.length <= 105`
- `30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100`

## Solution
This is a problem of a monotonic stack. This means that the values of the stack decrease or are equal in value. We store the temperatures as a tuple in the stack, one the temp and the other the index in the array. If the value in the array is bigger than the value in the stack we make a loop popping out all of those values that are less than the current value and we store in the result array the difference between their indexes, which we would have previously initialize to zero.

```python
def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
	res = [0] * len(temperatures)
	stack = [] # tuple (temperature index)
	
	for i, t in enumerate(temperatures):
		while stack and t > stack[-1][0]:
			stackTemp, stackInd = stack.pop()
			res[stackInd] = i - stackInd
		stack.append((t, i))
	
	return res
```
