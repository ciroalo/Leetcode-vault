## Problem
You are given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` is the weight of the `ith` stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the **heaviest two stones** and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:

- If `x == y`, both stones are destroyed, and
- If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y - x`.

At the end of the game, there is **at most one** stone left.
Return _the weight of the last remaining stone_. If there are no stones left, return `0`.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** 
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of the last stone.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** stones = [1]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= stones.length <= 30`
- `1 <= stones[i] <= 1000`

## My Solution
I used the python library for min heaps with the little touch that I inverted the array (multiplied by `-1`): 

```python
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        stones = [-x for x in stones]
        heapq.heapify(stones)

        while len(stones) > 1:
            a = (-1) * heapq.heappop(stones)
            b = (-1) * heapq.heappop(stones)

            a -= b
            if a > 0:
                heapq.heappush(stones, a * (-1))

        if not stones:
            return 0

        return (-1) * heapq.heappop(stones)
```
