## Problem
Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest** **substring** without duplicate characters.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** s = "abcabcbb"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** s = "bbbbb"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

**Example 3:**
**Input:** s = "pwwkew"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## My Solution
I used a sliding window technique, might not be very efficient but i had trouble with the special characters used in the string:

```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
	count_map = dict.fromkeys(string.ascii_lowercase, 0)
	left, right = 0, 0
	best = 0
	  
	while right < len(s):
		if s[right] not in count_map:
			count_map[s[right]] = 1
		else:
			count_map[s[right]] += 1
		  
		while count_map[s[right]] > 1:
			count_map[s[left]] -= 1
			left += 1
		  
		current = right - left + 1
		best = max(best, current)
		right += 1
	  
	return best
```

## Most Effective Solutions
```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int: 
	left = max_length = 0 
	char_set = set() 
	
	for right in range(len(s)): 
		while s[right] in char_set: 
			char_set.remove(s[left]) 
			left += 1 
			
		char_set.add(s[right]) 
		max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1) 
	
	return max_length
```
