## Problem
Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return _the reversed list_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** [5,4,3,2,1]

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex2.jpg)

**Input:** head = [1,2]
**Output:** [2,1]

**Example 3:**
**Input:** head = []
**Output:** []

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

**Follow up:** A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

## My Solution
At first I wasn't taking into account that the first element next value would have to point to `None`.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
# def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
# self.val = val
# self.next = next
class Solution:
	def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
		prev = None
		current = head
		  
		while current:
			next_node = current.next
			current.next = prev
			prev = current
			current = next_node
		
		return prev
```
