## Problem
Table: `Employees`

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| employee_id  | int           |
| name              |  varchar  |
| salary              | int           |

employee_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the employee ID, employee name, and salary.

Write a solution to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is `100%` of their salary if the ID of the employee is **an odd number** and **the employee's name does not start with the character** `'M'`. The bonus of an employee is `0` otherwise.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 
Employees table:

| employee_id | name    | salary |
| ------------- | --------- | -------- |
| 2           | Meir    | 3000   |
| 3           | Michael | 3800   |
| 7           | Addilyn | 7400   |
| 8           | Juan    | 6100   |
| 9           | Kannon  | 7700   |

**Output:** 

| employee_id | bonus |
|-------------|-------|
| 2           | 0     |
| 3           | 0     |
| 7           | 7400  |
| 8           | 0     |
| 9           | 7700  |

**Explanation:** 
The employees with IDs 2 and 8 get 0 bonus because they have an even employee_id.
The employee with ID 3 gets 0 bonus because their name starts with 'M'.
The rest of the employees get a 100% bonus.

## My solution
My solution doesn't even make sense, I am sure in the future I will be able to solve this type of problems:

```mysql
SELECT E.employee_id, bonus

FROM Employees as E

WHERE bonus is (IF E.employee_id > 4 THEN E.salary ELSE 0)
```

## Efficient Solutions
### Solution 1
```mysql
-- select entries with odd employee id and name not start with M 
select employee_id , salary as bonus 
from employees 
where employee_id%2 <>0 and name not like 'M%' 

-- join both selection 
union 

-- select remaining entries from table 
select employee_id , 0 as bonus 
from employees 
where employee_id%2 = 0 or name like 'M%' order by employee_id;
```

### Solution 2
```mysql
select employee_id , salary * ( employee_id%2 ) * ( name not like 'M%') as bonus from employees order by employee_id;
```

In this case the `*` operator means simply multiply. 

If `employee_id` is odd, then `employee_id%2` will return a 1, and if the name doesn't start with an M `name not like 'M%'` will return 1. 

If the return value of any of them is zero, then on multiplying with the salary, the bonus becomes zero, else the bonus is equal to the salary.


### Solution 3 - Case Statement
```mysql
select employee_id , 
case when employee_id%2 <>0 and name not like 'M%' then salary 
else 0 
end 
as bonus 
from employees 
order by employee_id;
```
