## Problem
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** n = 5, bad = 4
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:**
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** n = 1, bad = 1
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1`

## Solution
### Approach & Explanation
This is a **classic binary search** problem:
- Versions are sequential.
- Once a version is bad, **all following versions are bad**.
- We need to find the **smallest index** for which `isBadVersion(version)` is `True`.
### Key Steps
1. Initialize two pointers: `left = 1`, `right = n`.
2. While `left < right`:
    - Find the midpoint: `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`
    - If `isBadVersion(mid)` is **True**, then the first bad version is at `mid` or before. So set `right = mid`.
    - If `isBadVersion(mid)` is **False**, the first bad version is after `mid`. So set `left = mid + 1`.
3. When `left == right`, it is the first bad version.

```python
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        left, right = 1, n
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if isBadVersion(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
         
        return left
```
