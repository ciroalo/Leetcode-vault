## Problem
Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return _this repeated number_.

You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and using only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**
**Input:** nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
**Output:** 3

**Example 3:**
**Input:** nums = [3,3,3,3,3]
**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `nums.length == n + 1`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the integers in `nums` appear only **once** except for **precisely one integer** which appears **two or more** times.

**Follow up:**
- How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
- Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?

## Solution
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive:

- There is only **one repeated number**, but it could be repeated **more than once**.
- Return the **duplicate** number without modifying the array and using only **constant extra space**.
### Approach: Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection)
We treat the array like a **linked list**, where each value points to the next index:  
`nums[i]` is the **next node**.

Since one number is duplicated, this structure **must form a cycle**.

#### Steps:
1. **Phase 1 - Finding the intersection point**:
    - Initialize two pointers: `slow` and `fast`.        
    - Move `slow` one step at a time and `fast` two steps.
    - They are guaranteed to meet inside the cycle.
2. **Phase 2 - Finding the entrance to the cycle**:
    - Reset one pointer to the start.
    - Move both one step at a time.
    - The node where they meet is the **duplicate number**.


```python
def findDuplicate(nums):
    # Phase 1: Finding the intersection point of the two runners
    slow = nums[0]
    fast = nums[0]

    while True:
        slow = nums[slow]
        fast = nums[nums[fast]]
        if slow == fast:
            break

    # Phase 2: Finding the entrance to the cycle
    slow = nums[0]
    while slow != fast:
        slow = nums[slow]
        fast = nums[fast]

    return slow
```

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` — constant extra space

## Math behind the Solution
Let us model the array `nums` as a linked list, where each index points to the value at that index:
$$
i \rightarrow \texttt{nums}[i]
$$

Since there are \( n+1 \) values in the range \([1, n]\), by the **Pigeonhole Principle**, there must be at least one duplicate. This guarantees a cycle in the "linked list" formed by the indices and values.

### Step 1: Detecting the cycle
We define a function:
$$
f(x) = \texttt{nums}[x]
$$
and a sequence:
$$
x_0 = \texttt{nums}[0],\quad x_1 = f(x_0),\quad x_2 = f(x_1),\quad \dots
$$

Let:
$$
\mu = \text{distance to cycle start} \\
\lambda = \text{length of cycle}
$$

When `slow` and `fast` meet:
$$
\text{slow} = \mu + k\lambda \\
\text{fast} = \mu + 2k\lambda
$$
for some integer \( k \geq 1 \).

### Step 2: Finding the cycle entrance
After reset:
- One pointer goes back to the start.
- Both pointers move one step at a time:
$$
\text{new slow} = x_0 \\
\text{new fast} = \text{intersection}
$$

They will meet again at:
$$
\text{duplicate} = \mu
$$

Thus, the duplicate number is the **entry point of the cycle**.
