## Problem
Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return `true` if the tree has a **root-to-leaf** path such that adding up all the values along the path equals `targetSum`.

A **leaf** is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/18/pathsum1.jpg)

**Input:** root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.

**Example 2:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/18/pathsum2.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There are two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
(1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
(1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.

**Example 3:**
**Input:** root = [], targetSum = 0
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000`

## My Solution
 I used a recursive approach for this solution for this problem. In this recursive method, first we:
 1. **Check** if the current node is not null.
 2. **Check** if the node is a leaf, if it is we return if what remain is *zero*.
 3. **Return** if its true for the left subtree *or* the right subtree.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def hasPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> bool:
        def path(node, remain):
            if not node:
                return False

            remain = remain - node.val
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                return remain == 0

            return path(node.left, remain) or path(node.right, remain)

        return path(root, targetSum)
```
