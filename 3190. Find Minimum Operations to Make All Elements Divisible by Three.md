## Problem
You are given an integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can add or subtract 1 from **any** element of `nums`.

Return the **minimum** number of operations to make all elements of `nums` divisible by 3.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]
**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**
All array elements can be made divisible by 3 using 3 operations:

- Subtract 1 from 1.
- Add 1 to 2.
- Subtract 1 from 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,6,9]
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 50`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 50`


## My Solution
```python
def minimumOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
	cont = 0
	for element in nums:
		if element % 3 != 0:
		cont += 1
	
	return cont
```

We know that if each integer at most, is one step away from being divisible by `three`. Thus, the problem is to count the numbers that are not directly divisible by `three`. 

In my answer, I just iterate through the loop and count the number of elements which `element % 3` is not zero.

My solution beats 100% of the other solutions:

## Effective solution
There is no other solution more effective than mine but we can make it one liner in python:

```python
def minimumOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(n % 3 != 0 for n in nums)
```

I have checked if there is any way to make it more efficient memory wise, but it appears that the most memory effective solution is exactly like mine.
