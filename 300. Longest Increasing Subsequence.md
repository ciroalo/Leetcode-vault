## Problem
Given an integer array `nums`, return _the length of the longest **strictly increasing**_ _**subsequence**_.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
**Output:** 4

**Example 3:**
**Input:** nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(n log(n))` time complexity?

## Solution - Dynamic Programming
We know that that the maximum subsequence starting at the last character is `1`. From there we can infer that the previous character would either be `1` again being it sole character, or if it's lower than the next character `2`. 

Following the same logic we know that for each index of nums, we will have that it will be the maximum value stored in the `dp` array, as long as the condition `nums[i] < nums[j]`.

At the end we return the max value stored in the `dp` array:
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [1] * len(nums)

        for i in range(len(nums), -1, -1):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] < nums[j]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], 1 + dp[j])

        return max(dp)
```
