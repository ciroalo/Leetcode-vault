## Problem
Given the `root` of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return _its root_.

**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/invert1-tree.jpg)

**Input:** root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
**Output:** [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]

**Example 2:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/invert2-tree.jpg)

**Input:** root = [2,1,3]
**Output:** [2,3,1]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = []
**Output:** []

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## My Solution
I created a stack where I would insert the nodes to change their right and left pointers. If they have a child, I insert them into the stack to later change their pointers
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
# def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
# self.val = val
# self.left = left
# self.right = right
class Solution:
	def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
		stack = []
		node = root
		
		while node:
			left, right = node.left, node.right
			node.left, node.right = right, left
			  
			if left:
				stack.append(left)
			if right:
				stack.append(right)
				
			node = stack.pop() if stack else None
		
		return root
```
