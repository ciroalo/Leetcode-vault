## Problem
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return _the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses_. If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [ [1,0] ]
**Output:** [0,1]
**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].

**Example 2:**
**Input:** numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [ [1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2] ]
**Output:** [0,2,1,3]
**Explanation:** There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].

**Example 3:**
**Input:** numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
**Output:** [0]

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
- `ai != bi`
- All the pairs `[ai, bi]` are **distinct**.


## My Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def findOrder(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        graph = defaultdict(list)

        for course, prereq in prerequisites:
            graph[course].append(prereq)

        visit = set()
        checked = set()
        result = []

        def dfs(course):
            if course in visit:
                return False
            if course in checked:
                return True

            visit.add(course)
            for prereq in graph[course]:
                if not dfs(prereq):
                    return False
            
            visit.remove(course)
            result.append(course)
            checked.add(course)

            return True

        for c in range(numCourses):
            if not dfs(c):
                return []
        
        return result
```

## Most Effective Solution

### **Problem Summary**

You are given `numCourses` and a list of prerequisite pairs. Each pair `(a, b)` means to take course `a`, you must first complete course `b`.  
You need to return an order in which you can take all courses (a topological order of the graph). If it’s impossible (because of a cycle), return an empty list.
### **Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code**
#### **1. Build the Graph and Compute In-Degree**
```python
graph = defaultdict(list) 
in_degree = [0] * numCourses`
```

- **graph**: Stores the adjacency list representation of the graph.  
    Example: if `prerequisites = [[1,0], [2,0], [3,1]]`,  
    `graph = {0: [1, 2], 1: [3]}`
- **in_degree**: Keeps track of how many prerequisites each course has (number of incoming edges).  
    Example: `in_degree = [0, 1, 1, 1]` (course 0 has no prerequisites, course 1 needs 1, etc.)

#### **2. Populate Graph and In-Degree**
```python
for course, prereq in prerequisites:     
	graph[prereq].append(course)     
	in_degree[course] += 1
```

For each pair `(course, prereq)`:

- Add `course` to `graph[prereq]` because you can take `course` only after `prereq`.
- Increment `in_degree[course]` because `course` has one more prerequisite.

#### **3. Initialize Queue with Courses Having No Prerequisites**
```python
queue = deque([i for i in range(numCourses) if in_degree[i] == 0])
```

- Start with all courses that **don’t require any prerequisite** (in-degree = 0).
- These are the courses you can take first.

Example: If `in_degree = [0, 1, 1, 1]`, then `queue = [0]`.

#### **4. BFS to Generate Topological Order**
```python
result = []  
while queue:     
	current = queue.popleft()     
	result.append(current)
```

- Remove a course from the queue. 
- Add it to the result (this represents taking that course).
#### **5. Reduce In-Degree of Neighbors**

```python
for neighbor in graph[current]:
	in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
	if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:         
		queue.append(neighbor)
```

- After taking `current`, all its neighbors now have one less prerequisite.
- If any neighbor’s in-degree becomes 0, it means we can take that course next, so add it to the queue

#### **6. Check if All Courses Are Taken**
```python
return result if len(result) == numCourses else []
```

- If the number of courses in `result` equals `numCourses`, it means we were able to schedule all courses.
- Otherwise, there’s a cycle (impossible to finish all courses), so return `[]`.

### **Example Walkthrough**

**Input:**
`numCourses = 4 prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]`

**Graph:**
`0 -> [1, 2] 1 -> [3] 2 -> [3]`

**In-Degree:**
`[0, 1, 1, 2]`

**Process:**
- Start queue: `[0]`
- Pop 0 → result: `[0]`, decrease in-degree of 1 & 2 → `[0, 0, 1, 2]`
- Add 1 and 2 to queue: `[1, 2]`
- Pop 1 → result: `[0,1]`, decrease in-degree of 3 → `[0,0,0,1]`
- Pop 2 → result: `[0,1,2]`, decrease in-degree of 3 → `[0,0,0,0]`
- Add 3 to queue: `[3]`
- Pop 3 → result: `[0,1,2,3]`

**Output:** `[0,1,2,3]`

### **Time & Space Complexity**

- **Time Complexity:** `O(V + E)`  
    `V = numCourses`, `E = len(prerequisites)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(V + E)`  
    For the graph and in-degree array.

```python
class Solution:
    def findOrder(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        in_degrees = [0] * numCourses

        for course, prereq in prerequisites:
            graph[prereq].append(course)
            in_degrees[course] += 1

        queue = deque([i for i in range(numCourses) if in_degrees[i] == 0])

        result = []
        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()
            result.append(current)

            for neighbor in graph[current]:
                in_degrees[neighbor] -= 1
                if in_degrees[neighbor] == 0:
                    queue.append(neighbor)

        return result if len(result) == numCourses else []
```
