## Problem
A **sentence** is a list of words that are separated by a **single** space with no leading or trailing spaces.

- For example, `"Hello World"`, `"HELLO"`, `"hello world hello world"` are all sentences.

Words consist of **only** uppercase and lowercase English letters. Uppercase and lowercase English letters are considered different.

A sentence is **circular** if:

- The last character of each word in the sentence is equal to the first character of its next word.
- The last character of the last word is equal to the first character of the first word.

For example, `"leetcode exercises sound delightful"`, `"eetcode"`, `"leetcode eats soul"` are all circular sentences. However, `"Leetcode is cool"`, `"happy Leetcode"`, `"Leetcode"` and `"I like Leetcode"` are **not** circular sentences.

Given a string `sentence`, return `true` _if it is circular_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** sentence = "leetcode exercises sound delightful"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The words in sentence are ["leetcode", "exercises", "sound", "delightful"].
- leetcode's last character is equal to exercises's first character.
- exercises's last character is equal to sound's first character.
- sound's last character is equal to delightful's first character.
- delightful's last character is equal to leetcode's first character.
The sentence is circular.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** sentence = "eetcode"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The words in sentence are ["eetcode"].
- eetcode's last character is equal to eetcode's first character.
The sentence is circular.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** sentence = "Leetcode is cool"
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The words in sentence are ["Leetcode", "is", "cool"].
- Leetcode's last character is **not** equal to is's first character.
The sentence is **not** circular.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= sentence.length <= 500`
- `sentence` consist of only lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.
- The words in `sentence` are separated by a single space.
- There are no leading or trailing spaces.

## My Solution
```python
class Solution:

	def isCircularSentence(self, sentence: str) -> bool:
		split_sent= sentence.split(' ')
		len_split = len(split_sent)
		
		for i in range(len_split):
			next = (i+1) % len_split
			if split_sent[i][-1] != split_sent[next][0]:
				return False
	
		return True
```

My solution was to split the sentence into a list of words, from there we get the length of this array. From there we iterate through the list with an index, from that index we get the the next word, if its the last, it will get the first word. 

Then we check if the last character of the current word and the first character of the next word match, if they don't, we return with a `False` value. If not, we return `True` at the end of the method.

## Most Effective Solutions
### Space-optimized Approach
In this solution, instead of treating the words separately from the sentence, it treats the sentence as a whole, from there it checks if the base case of the first and last word match, if they don't it returns `False`. 

From there it iterates through all the characters in the sentence until if finds a space, then checks for the character before and after the space, if they don't match it returns `False` again. If all was good it returns `True`.

In this case we can check that:
- **Time complexity:** `O(n)`. The algorithm iterates through the list of words exactly once. During each iteration, it performs constant-time operations. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear.
- **Space complexity** `O(1)`. The algorithm uses few variables, which do not depend on the length of the string. No additional data structures are created to store the results, so the overall space complexity is constant.

```python
class Solution:
	def isCircularSentence(self, sentence: str) -> bool:
		n = len(sentence)

		if sentence[0] != sentence[-1]:
			return False
			
		for i in range (1, n-1):
			if sentence[i] = ' ':
				if sentence[i-1] != sentence[i+1]:
					return False
					
		return True
```


### Split Sentence
```python
class Solution:
    def isCircularSentence(self, sentence: str) -> bool:
        # Use the split function to store the words in a list.
        words = sentence.split(" ")
        n = len(words)

        # Start comparing from the last character of the last word.
        last = words[n - 1][-1]

        for i in range(n):
            # If this character is not equal to the first character of current word, return
            # false.
            if words[i][0] != last:
                return False
            last = words[i][-1]

        return True
```

It's the same as my solution, but it separates the base case from the loop, making it more simple, readable and faster.

- Time complexity: `O(n)` The algorithm iterates through the list of words exactly once. During each iteration, it performs constant-time operations. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear.
- Space complexity: `O(n)`. The space complexity is determined by the `words` array created by the split function, which holds `n` words. This requires O(n) space. Additionally, no other significant space is used apart from a few variables, which contributes only a constant amount of space.
