## Problem
Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `ith` pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return _the minimum integer_ `k` _such that she can eat all the bananas within_ `h` _hours_.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**
**Input:** piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
**Output:** 30

**Example 3:**
**Input:** piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
**Output:** 23

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= piles.length <= 104`
- `piles.length <= h <= 109`
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 109`

## My Solution
I applied a binary search algorithm to be able to reduce the search time exponentially. 

```python
class Solution:
	def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
		minSpeed, maxSpeed = ceil(sum(piles)/h), max(piles)
		output = 1
		
		while minSpeed <= maxSpeed:
			eatingSpeed = minSpeed + (maxSpeed - minSpeed) // 2
			eatingTime = sum(math.ceil(pile / eatingSpeed) for pile in piles)
			
			if eatingTime > h:
				minSpeed = eatingSpeed + 1
			else:
				maxSpeed = eatingSpeed - 1
				output = eatingSpeed
		
		return output
```

The first optimization done is the minSpeed, which would be `ceil(sum(piles/h))` with this line of code we can pick the smallest possible number which could be, instead of `1` or `len(piles)` and with bigger numbers it would be all more noticeable. The maxSpeed is set to `max(piles)` which would set the `eatingTime` to `len(piles)` which is the fastest that koko could eat all the bananas.

Then we apply the binary search algorithm, and when the eatingTime is bigger than `h` it means that koko couldn't finish all the bananas in that timeframe, but if it's less or equal we store the value and update the left and right pointers.
