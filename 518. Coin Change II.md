## Problem
You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the number of combinations that make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `0`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

The answer is **guaranteed** to fit into a signed **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1

**Example 2:**
**Input:** amount = 3, coins = [2]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.

**Example 3:**
**Input:** amount = 10, coins = [10]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= coins.length <= 300`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 5000`
- All the values of `coins` are **unique**.
- `0 <= amount <= 5000`


## Solution with Memoization
This one follows a recursive solution where to avoid duplicate paths we are gonna set that for each coin, we are only allowed to use that coin and the ones to the right in the coins array:

```python
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        cache = {}

        def dfs(i, a):
            if a == amount:
                return 1
            if a > amount:
                return 0
            if i == len(coins):
                return 0
            if (i, a) in cache:
                return cache[(i, a)]

            cache[(i, a)] = dfs(i, a + coins[i]) + dfs(i + 1, a)
            return cache[(i, a)]

        return dfs(0, 0)
```

## Solution with Dynamic Programming
In this solution we are gonna follow a dynamic programming approach where we will calculate the different ways we can get to each value before amount. Instead of creating a whole array for the dp, we are gonna be using just two rows:

```python
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 1

        for i in range(len(coins) - 1, -1, -1):
            nextDP = [0] * (amount + 1)
            nextDP[0] = 1

            for a in range(1, amount + 1):
                nextDP[a] = dp[a]
                if a - coins[i] >= 0:
                    nextDP[a] += nextDP[a - coins[i]]
            
            dp = nextDP
        
        return dp[amount]
```
