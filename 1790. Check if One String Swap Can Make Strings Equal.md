## Problem
You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length. A **string swap** is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.

Return `true` _if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing **at most one string swap** on **exactly one** of the strings._ Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** For example, swap the first character with the last character of s2 to make "bank".

**Example 2:**
**Input:** s1 = "attack", s2 = "defend"
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** It is impossible to make them equal with one string swap.

**Example 3:**
**Input:** s1 = "kelb", s2 = "kelb"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The two strings are already equal, so no string swap operation is required.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
- `s1.length == s2.length`
- `s1` and `s2` consist of only lowercase English letters.

## My Solution

```python
def areAlmostEqual(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
	diff = []
	
	for i in range(len(s1)):
		if s1[i] != s2[i]:
			diff.append((s1[i], s2[i]))
			if len(diff) > 2:
				return False
			
	if not diff:
		return True
		
	if len(diff) != 2:
		return False
	
	return diff[0] == diff[1][::-1]
```

The way I thought it was the next. For the words to be the same with at most one swap, there could only be two characters placed in the incorrect place in each string.

So for every index I check if the characters are the same, if they are not I store them as a tuple `(s1[i], s2[i])` in a list called `diff`. If the len of the list surpasses `2` there is nothing we could do and we return immediately.

After iterating through each character, if the list with the differences is empty it means they are already the same. If they are something different of 2, it means it can't be swapped.

The last line `return diff[0] == diff[1][::-1]` is checking whether the two mismatched characters pairs are swappable.

Suppose:
```python
s1 = "bank" 
s2 = "kanb"
```

They differ in two positions:
- `s1[0] = 'b'`, `s2[0] = 'k'` → difference 1: `('b', 'k')`
- `s1[3] = 'k'`, `s2[3] = 'b'` → difference 2: `('k', 'b')`

So, `diff = [('b', 'k'), ('k', 'b')]`

Now this line `diff[1][::-1]` does a reverse of the second pair. 
- `('k', 'b')[::-1] => ('b', 'k')`

Then the comparison becomes: 
`('b', 'k') == ('b', 'k')`

## Most Effective Solutions
### Approach 1: Only Check Differences

#### Intuition

For our previous approach, we already achieved an efficient constant space complexity. However, let's try to optimize further and see if we can check if the two strings can be made equal without using the frequency maps.

Let's take another look at the example `s1 = bank` and `s2 = kanb`. We previously established that there are exactly 2 character differences: at index 0 and index 3. This makes it possible for one string swap to make the strings equal.

However, we can make a more specific observation: This swap only works because the character at index 0 of `s1` matches the character at index 3 of `s2`. Similarly, the character at index 3 for `s1` is equal to the character at index 0 for `s2`. In other words, if the characters in the mismatched positions "cross-match", a swap will be able to make the strings equal.

![Swap matching](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-one-string-swap-can-make-strings-equal/solutions/6337236/Figures/1790/swap.png)

This leads us to a stricter rule:

- For the strings to be equal after a single swap, there must be exactly two mismatched indices, `i` and `j`, such that:
    1. `s1[i] == s2[j]`
    2. `s1[j] == s2[i]`

Similar to before, if the strings are already identical, no swap is needed. In all other cases, equality is not possible.

For this rule, we can simply introduce two new variables `firstIndexDiff` and `secondIndexDiff` to keep track of the indices of differences. We continue to use `numDiffs` to make sure the `numDiffs` doesn't surpass 2. We will iterate through `s1` and `s2` like we do in approach 1, except we now update `firstIndexDiff`, `secondIndexDiff`, and `numDiffs` when we see a character difference.

> Note: For this approach's implementation, observe that we do not have to explicitly check the trivial edge case where `s1` and `s2` are equal. If the two strings are equal, then no diffs are found, and `s1[firstIndexDiff] == s2[secondIndexDiff] && s1[secondIndexDiff] == s2[firstIndexDiff]` will always be true, assuming the default initialized values of `firstIndexDiff` and `secondIndexDiff` are valid (they can just be 0).

#### Algorithm

- Initialize `firstIndexDiff`, `secondIndexDiff`, and `numDiffs` all to 0.
- Iterate through the characters of `s1` and `s2`:
    - Let `s1Char` and `s2Char` be the current characters of `s1` and `s2` at index `i`, respectively.
    - If `s1Char != s2Char`:
        - Increment `numDiffs`.
        - If `numDiffs` is now greater than `2`, then we know one string swap will not make the strings equal, so return `false`.
        - If `numDiffs` is now equal to `1`, then we have found our first difference: assign `firstIndexDiff = i`.
        - Otherwise, `numDiffs` is `2` so we have found our second difference: assign `secondIndexDiff = i`.
- Return `s1[firstIndexDiff] == s2[secondIndexDiff] && s1[secondIndexDiff] == s2[firstIndexDiff]`

#### Implementation
```python 
class Solution:
    def areAlmostEqual(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        first_index_diff = 0
        second_index_diff = 0
        num_diffs = 0
        for i in range(len(s1)):
            if s1[i] != s2[i]:
                num_diffs += 1
                # num_diffs is more than 2, one string swap will not make two strings equal
                if num_diffs > 2:
                    return False
                elif num_diffs == 1:
                    # store the index of first difference
                    first_index_diff = i
                else:
                    # store the index of second difference
                    second_index_diff = i
        # check if swap is possible
        return (
            s1[first_index_diff] == s2[second_index_diff]
            and s1[second_index_diff] == s2[first_index_diff]
        )
```
#### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(N) Iterating through `s1` and `s2` takes O(N) time. For each character we iterate, updating `numDiffs`, `firstIndexDiff`, `secondIndexDiff` takes O(1) constant time. Thus, the total time complexity is O(N).

- Space Complexity: O(1)

### Approach 2: Frequency Map + Check Differences

#### Intuition

To start, consider the example where `s1 = "bank"` and `s2 = "kanb"`. If we swap the first and last characters of `s1`, we get `"kanb"`, which matches `s2`. Alternatively, we could swap the first and last characters of `s2` to get `"bank"`, which matches `s1`. One observation we can make is that this swapping only works if the two strings share the same characters and frequencies. The only difference would be the ordering of characters.

In other words, it is necessary for the two strings to be anagrams for a string swap to be possible. Otherwise, one string will have a certain character that the other is missing, and no amount of swapping can make them equal.

However, two strings being anagrams is not enough to ensure swapping will make them equal. Let's consider another example: `s1 = hello` and `s2 = olleh`. We know that the two strings are anagrams, but it is still not possible for a single string swap to make `s1` equal to `s2` or vice versa. If we were to compare each character of `s1`, `s1[i]`, to its corresponding character in `s2`, `s2[i]`, we see that there is a total of 4 differences at indices `i = 0, 1, 3, 4`. One string swap can only resolve two differences, so they cannot be made equal. This leads us to our second requirement for a string swap to be possible: If there are any differences, the total number of character-by-character differences has to be exactly 2. Note the edge case where `s1` and `s2` are already equal, in which there are 0 character-by-character differences and no string swaps are needed.

Now, we have fully developed a rule for determining if the two strings can be made equal:

- If `s1` and `s2` are already equal, then no string swap is needed and we know it's trivially possible for the strings to be equal.
- If `s1` and `s2` have the same set of character frequencies (i.e. are anagrams) and have exactly 2 character-by-character differences, then we know it's possible to make the strings equal with 1 string swap.
- Otherwise, the two strings can't be made equal with one string swap.

To implement these checks, we can use two frequency maps `s1FrequencyMap` and `s2FrequencyMap` to keep track of the frequency of each letter for the two strings. As we go through the characters of the two strings and populate the frequency maps, we can also maintain counter `numDiffs` that counts the number of differences at corresponding indices. If the two strings are anagrams and `numDiffs` equals 2, we know that one swap can resolve the differences.

#### Algorithm

- Check edge case: if `s1` and `s2` are already equal, then return `true`.
- Initialize the frequency maps for each string: `s1FrequencyMap` and `s2FrequencyMap` are character arrays of size 26.
- Initialize the counter `numDiffs` to maintain the number of character differences between the two strings.
- Iterate through the characters of `s1` and `s2`:
    - Let `s1Char` and `s2Char` be the current characters of `s1` and `s2`, respectively.
    - If `s1Char != s2Char`, then increment `numDiffs`. If `numDiffs` is now greater than `2`, then we know one string swap will not make the strings equal, so return `false`.
    - Update the frequency maps by incrementing the frequency of `s1Char` and `s2Char`: `s1FrequencyMap[s1Char]++` and `s2FrequencyMap[s2Char]++`.
- Now, the strings are equal only if the frequency maps are equal (at this point, we know `numDiffs` is exactly 2): If `s1FrequencyMap` and `s2FrequencyMap` have the same frequencies, then return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

#### Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def areAlmostEqual(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        if s1 == s2:
            return True
        s1_frequency_map = [0] * 26
        s2_frequency_map = [0] * 26
        num_diffs = 0

        for i in range(len(s1)):
            s1_char = s1[i]
            s2_char = s2[i]

            if s1_char != s2_char:
                num_diffs += 1
                # num_diffs is more than 2, one string swap will not make two strings equal
                if num_diffs > 2:
                    return False

            # increment frequencies
            s1_frequency_map[ord(s1_char) - ord("a")] += 1
            s2_frequency_map[ord(s2_char) - ord("a")] += 1

        # check if frequencies are equal
        return s1_frequency_map == s2_frequency_map
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let N be the length of `s1` and `s2`.

- Time Complexity: `O(N)`. Iterating through `s1` and `s2` takes O(N) time. For each character we iterate, updating the frequency maps and diff counter takes O(1) constant time. Thus, the total time complexity is O(N).
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`. Each frequency map has a fixed size of 26, regardless of the length of `s1` and `s2`. Thus, the space complexity is O(1) constant time.
