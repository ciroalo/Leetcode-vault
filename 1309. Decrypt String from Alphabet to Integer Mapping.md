## Problem
You are given a string `s` formed by digits and `'#'`. We want to map `s` to English lowercase characters as follows:

- Characters (`'a'` to `'i'`) are represented by (`'1'` to `'9'`) respectively.
- Characters (`'j'` to `'z'`) are represented by (`'10#'` to `'26#'`) respectively.

Return _the string formed after mapping_.

The test cases are generated so that a unique mapping will always exist.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "10#11#12"
**Output:** "jkab"
**Explanation:** "j" -> "10#" , "k" -> "11#" , "a" -> "1" , "b" -> "2".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "1326#"
**Output:** "acz"

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of digits and the `'#'` letter.
- `s` will be a valid string such that mapping is always possible.


## My Solution
There is two ways to approach this problem, traversing the string from `left-to-right` or from `right-to-left`. One of the handicaps I found from the `left-to-right` is that to check if there is a `#` character two positions away, you have to also double check if you are at the end of the string or not. Following that I decided to do a `right-to-left` approach in my code.

```python
def freqAlphabets(self, s: str) -> str:
	decrypted_str = ''
	i = len(s) -1
	
	while (i >= 0):
		if s[i] == '#':
			ds = s[i-2:i]
			decrypted_str = chr(int(ds) + ord('a') - 1) + decrypted_str
			i -= 3
		else:
			ds = s[i]
			decrypted_str = chr(int(ds) + ord('a') - 1) + decrypted_str
			i -= 1
	
	return decrypted_str
```

This piece of code `chr(int(ds) + ord('a') - 1)` easily allow us to get the character based in the number of the alphabet.

## Most Effective Solution

```python
class Solution: 
	def freqAlphabets(self, s: str) -> str: 
		for i in range(26,0,-1): 
			s = s.replace(str(i)+'#'*(i>9),chr(96+i)) 
			
		return s 
```

The loop runs backwards from 26 to 1, so that longer patterns like `11#` are replaced before the single digits.

`str(i)+'#'*(i>9)`:
- If `i > 9`, it appends a `#` (e.g., `'10#'`, `'11#'`, ..., `'26#'`)
- If `i ≤ 9`, no `#` is appended (just `'1'`, `'2'`, ..., `'9'`)
