## Problem
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/12/ex_depth.jpg)
**Input:** root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**
**Input:** root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
**Output:** 5

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 105]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Solution
I followed a dfs algorithm, but it would be also interesting to try an bfs approach:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        def depth(node):
            if not node:
                return 0

            if not node.left:
                return 1 + depth(node.right)
            
            if not node.right:
                return 1 + depth(node.left)

            left = depth(node.left)
            right = depth(node.right)

            return 1 + min(left, right)

        return depth(root)
```
