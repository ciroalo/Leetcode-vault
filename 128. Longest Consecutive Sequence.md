## Problem
Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Therefore its length is 4.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
**Output:** 9

**Example 3:**
**Input:** nums = [1,0,1,2]
**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

## My Solution
```python
def longestConsecutive(nums: List[int]) -> int:
	numSet = set(nums)
	longest = 0
	
	for n in numSet:
		if (n - 1) not in numSet:
			length = 0
			while (n + length) in numSet:
				length += 1
	
			longest = max(longest, length)
	
	return longest
```

Given an unsorted array of number with duplicates, we are tasked to return the length of the biggest sequence possible. 

One way to approach this problem is by iterating through the sequences. We start a sequence when a value doesn't have a left value neighbour. Then we will need to count how long the sequence is. If the value we are iterating is not a starting value we continue looping.

For that we store the array in a set, that way we eliminate duplicates and look-up times are shortened considerably. Then we loop through the set and check if the current value is a starting value. If it is we continue the sequence and count how long it is. If it's not we continue looping.
