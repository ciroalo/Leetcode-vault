## Problem
Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` _if_ `word` _exists in the grid_.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/word2.jpg)

**Input:** board = [ ["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"] ], word = "ABCCED"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/word-1.jpg)

**Input:** board = [ ["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"] ], word = "SEE"
**Output:** true

**Example 3:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/15/word3.jpg)

**Input:** board = [ ["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"] ], word = "ABCB"
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**
- `m == board.length`
- `n = board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 6`
- `1 <= word.length <= 15`
- `board` and `word` consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you use search pruning to make your solution faster with a larger `board`?


## My Solution
I used a backtracking solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
        idx = len(board[0])
        idy = len(board)

        def search(i, x, y, path):
            if i == len(word):
                return True

            if x < 0 or x >= idx:
                return False

            if y < 0 or y >= idy:
                return False

            if (x, y) in path:
                return False

            if board[y][x] != word[i]:
                return False

            path.append((x, y))

            i += 1
            if search(i, x+1, y, path) or search(i, x-1, y, path):
                return True
            if search(i, x, y+1, path) or search(i, x, y-1, path):
                return True
            
            path.pop()
            return False

        for t in range(idy):
            for s in range(idx):
                if board[t][s] == word[0]:
                    if search(0, s, t, []):
                        return True

        return False
```

## Most Efficient Solution
This is a classic **backtracking** (DFS) problem.
### Key Idea
- For each cell in the grid, try to start searching for the word.
- At each step, move to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) to find the next character in the word.
- Mark cells as **visited** to prevent revisiting during the current path.
- If all characters in the word are found in sequence, return `True`.
### Step-by-Step Algorithm
1. **Iterate** over every cell in the grid.
2. For each cell, if the character matches the first character of `word`, **start a DFS** (Depth-First Search) from that cell.
3. In the DFS:
    - If the current index equals the word length, return `True` (found the word).
    - If out of bounds, or the character doesn’t match, or the cell is visited, return `False`.
    - Mark the cell as visited (commonly by temporarily changing its value).
    - Recursively search all four directions (up, down, left, right) for the next character.
    - **Backtrack**: Unmark the cell (restore the character).        
4. If any DFS call returns `True`, return `True`. If none succeed, return `False`.

```python
class Solution:
    def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
        rows, cols = len(board), len(board[0])

        def dfs(r, c, idx):
            if idx == len(word):
                return True

            if r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= rows or c >= cols:
                return False

            if board[r][c] != word[idx]:
                return False

            temp = board[r][c]
            board[r][c] = '#'

            found = (
                dfs(r+1, c, idx+1) or
                dfs(r, c+1, idx+1) or
                dfs(r-1, c, idx+1) or
                dfs(r, c-1, idx+1)
            )

            board[r][c] = temp
            return found

        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if board[i][j] == word[0] and dfs(i, j, 0):
                    return True

        return False
```
