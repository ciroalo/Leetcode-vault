## Problem
There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return _the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return_ `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

**Constraints:**
- `n == gas.length == cost.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104`
- The input is generated such that the answer is unique.

## Solution
For this problem is necessary a greedy solution. In this problem first we need to know the comparison between the gas found at the station and gas needed to move to the next station:

| Index | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gas   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| Cost  | 3   | 4   | 5   | 1   | 2   |
| Diff  | -2  | -2  | -2  | 3   | 3   |
 
The first thing to take into account is that to be able to traverse the entire circuit of gas stations, the amount of gas has to be equal or more than the amount of cost. If not, we return `-1`.

After checking that, we then have to traverse the array of gas/cost from left to right, adding the difference to a `total` variable, if it ever becomes less than zero, we update the total count to `0` and move the `res` variable (it will store the starting index), to the next value of the index we were currently in.  That way, the moment we get to the end of the array with a `total` of `>= than 0` we know that the the index in `res` is the solution: 

```python
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        if sum(gas) < sum(cost):
            return -1

        res = total = 0
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            total += (gas[i] - cost[i])

            if total < 0:
                total = 0
                res = i + 1
        
        return res
```
