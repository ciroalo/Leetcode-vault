## Problem
**Balanced** strings are those that have an equal quantity of `'L'` and `'R'` characters.

Given a **balanced** string `s`, split it into some number of substrings such that:
- Each substring is balanced.

Return _the **maximum** number of balanced strings you can obtain._

**Example 1:**
**Input:** s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
Note that s cannot be split into "RL", "RR", "RL", "LR", "LL", because the 2nd and 5th substrings are not balanced.

**Example 3:**
**Input:** s = "LLLLRRRR"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".

**Constraints:**
- `2 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s[i]` is either `'L'` or `'R'`.
- `s` is a **balanced** string.

## Solution
For this problem, we are keeping three counters, one for each type of letter (`left` and `right`) and the other one to count the number of balanced substrings (`result`).

Later we iterate through the array adding the current letter to its respective counter. If the counters match at any moment, it means that we have found a balanced substring so we increment by one the `result` variable and we update `left` and `right` back to `zero`:

```python
class Solution:
    def balancedStringSplit(self, s: str) -> int:
        left = right = result = 0

        for ch in s:
            if ch == "L":
                left += 1
            else:
                right += 1
            
            if left == right:
                result += 1
                left = right = 0

        return result
```
