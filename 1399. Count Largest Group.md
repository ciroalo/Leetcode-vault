## Problem
You are given an integer `n`.

Each number from `1` to `n` is grouped according to the sum of its digits.

Return _the number of groups that have the largest size_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 13
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** There are 9 groups in total, they are grouped according sum of its digits of numbers from 1 to 13:
[1,10], [2,11], [3,12], [4,13], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].
There are 4 groups with largest size.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** There are 2 groups [1], [2] of size 1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 104`

## My Solution

```python
def countLargestGroup(n: int) -> int:

	ocurrences = [0] * 37
	
	for number in range(1, n+1):
		str_num = str(number)
		index = 0
		for ch in str_num:
			index += int(ch)
	
		ocurrences[index] += 1
	
	return ocurrences.count(max(ocurrences))
```
