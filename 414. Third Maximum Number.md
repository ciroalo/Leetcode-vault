## Problem
Given an integer array `nums`, return _the **third distinct maximum** number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the **maximum** number_.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** nums = [3,2,1]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:**
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2.
The third distinct maximum is 1.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** nums = [1,2]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:**
The first distinct maximum is 2.
The second distinct maximum is 1.
The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.

**Example 3:**
**Input:** nums = [2,2,3,1]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:**
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).
The third distinct maximum is 1.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`

**Follow up:** Can you find an `O(n)` solution?

## My Solution
I applied a min heap solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def thirdMax(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # separate distinct numbers
        distinct = set(nums)
        if len(distinct) < 3:
            return max(distinct)

        min_heap = [x for x in distinct]
        heapq.heapify(min_heap)

        while len(min_heap) > 3:
            heapq.heappop(min_heap)

        return min_heap[0]
```

## Most Effective solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def thirdMax(self, nums):
        first = second = third = None
        for num in nums:
            if num == first or num == second or num == third:
                continue
            if first is None or num > first:
                third = second
                second = first
                first = num
            elif second is None or num > second:
                third = second
                second = num
            elif third is None or num > third:
                third = num
        return third if third is not None else first
```
