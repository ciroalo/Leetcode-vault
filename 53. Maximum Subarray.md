## Problem
Given an integer array `nums`, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return _its sum_.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** nums = [1]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.

**Example 3:**
**Input:** nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
**Output:** 23
**Explanation:** The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

**Follow up:** If you have figured out the `O(n)` solution, try coding another solution using the **divide and conquer** approach, which is more subtle.

## Solution
Instead of computing every single combination possible which would leave us with a solution of `O(n)`, we just need to apply a similar algorithm to the `sliding window` technique.

This time we are gonna make one pass, and if the current sum its less than `0`, we update the current sum variable to zero because the previous subarray it's not one we would like to have:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        maxSub = nums[0]
        curSum = 0

        for n in nums:
            if curSum < 0:
                curSum = 0
            curSum += n
            maxSub = max(maxSub, curSum)
        
        return maxSub
```
