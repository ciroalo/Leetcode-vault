## Problem
Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `nth` node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/remove_ex1.jpg)

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
**Output:** [1,2,3,5]

**Example 2:**
**Input:** head = [1], n = 1
**Output:** []

**Example 3:**
**Input:** head = [1,2], n = 1
**Output:** [1]

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
- `1 <= sz <= 30`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `1 <= n <= sz`

## My Solution
My solution includes a simple stack algorithm where I store all the nodes in a stack and keep popping them up till the nth element and get the previous element to point to the nth node next element.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
# def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
# self.val = val
# self.next = next
class Solution:
	def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
		node = head
		stack = []
		  
		while node:
			stack.append(node)
			node = node.next
		  
		for i in range(n - 1):
			stack.pop()
		  
		node = stack.pop()
		if stack:
			next_node = stack.pop()
			next_node.next = node.next
		else:
			head = node.next
		  
		return head
```

## Another Solution
We can use the `two pointers` approach to find the `Kth` element in the list starting from the back and that is to have the pointers at a `k` distance, so that we the faster one reaches the end, the slow one will point to the `Kth` element from the back. 

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
# def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
# self.val = val
# self.next = next
class Solution:
	def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
		slow = fast = head
		  
		for i in range(n):
			fast = fast.next
		  
		prev = None
		while fast:
			prev = slow
			fast = fast.next
			slow = slow.next
		  
		if prev:
			prev.next = slow.next
		else:
			head = slow.next
			
		return head
```

In practice it gives us the same result as the first approach:
