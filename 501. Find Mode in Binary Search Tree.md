## Problem
Given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return _all the [mode(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_\(statistics\)) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it_.

If the tree has more than one mode, return them in **any order**.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than or equal to** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than or equal to** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/11/mode-tree.jpg)
**Input:** root = [1,null,2,2]
**Output:** [2]

**Example 2:**
**Input:** root = [0]
**Output:** [0]

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`

**Follow up:** Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).


## Solution
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def findMode(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        self.prev = None
        self.count = 0
        self.max_count = 0

        def inorder(node):
            if not node:
                return
            inorder(node.left)

            if self.prev is None or node.val != self.prev:
                self.count = 1
            else:
                self.count += 1

            if self.count > self.max_count:
                self.max_count = self.count
                result.clear()
                result.append(node.val)
            elif self.count == self.max_count:
                result.append(node.val)
            
            self.prev = node.val
            inorder(node.right)


        inorder(root)
        return result
        
```

## Approach & Explanation
- In a BST, **in-order traversal** visits nodes in sorted order.
- As you traverse, count the occurrences of each value.
- Keep track of the **maximum count** and **all values** with that count.

To do this efficiently **in O(1) extra space (not counting output)**,   you can do an in-order traversal and update counts on-the-fly,  since equal values will always be visited consecutively.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes (each node visited once).
- **Space Complexity:** O(h), where h is the height of the tree (for recursion stack).
