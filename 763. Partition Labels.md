## Problem
You are given a string `s`. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. For example, the string `"ababcc"` can be partitioned into `["abab", "cc"]`, but partitions such as `["aba", "bcc"]` or `["ab", "ab", "cc"]` are invalid.

Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be `s`.

Return _a list of integers representing the size of these parts_.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
**Output:** [9,7,8]
**Explanation:**
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** s = "eccbbbbdec"
**Output:** [10]

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 500`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution
For this solution first we are gonna build a hash map where we are gonna store the last position found of a character. 

After that is done, we are gonna traverse the array, string the end of the substring, if we are in the last position of the subarray we store the size of that substring in `result` and update the `size` variable back to zero:

```python
class Solution:
    def partitionLabels(self, s: str) -> List[int]:
        index_map = defaultdict(int)

        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            index_map[c] = i
        
        result = []
        size = end = 0
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            size += 1
            end = max(end, index_map[c])

            if i == end:
                result.append(size)
                size = 0
                
        return result
```
