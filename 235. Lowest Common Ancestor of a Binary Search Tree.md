## Problem
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5 ], p = 2, q = 8
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

**Example 2:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)

**Input:** root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
- `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
- All `Node.val` are **unique**.
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the BST.

## Solution
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
# def __init__(self, x):
# self.val = x
# self.left = None
# self.right = None
  
class Solution:
	def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
		current = root
		  
		while current:
			if p.val > current.val and q.val > current.val:
				current = current.right
			elif p.val < current.val and q.val < current.val:
				current = current.left
			else:
				return current
```

### **Key BST Properties**
- For any node:
    - All values in the **left subtree** are **less** than the node’s value.
    - All values in the **right subtree** are **greater** than the node’s value.
### **Strategy**
You can use these BST properties to efficiently find the LCA:
1. **Start at the root.**
2. **Compare `p` and `q` to the current node:**
    - If **both** `p` and `q` are **smaller**, LCA must be in the **left** subtree.
    - If **both** `p` and `q` are **greater**, LCA must be in the **right** subtree.
    - If they split (i.e., one is on the left, the other on the right, or one equals the current node), **current node is the LCA**.
## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(h), where h is the height of the tree (O(log n) for a balanced BST).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), iterative approach; no recursion stack needed.
