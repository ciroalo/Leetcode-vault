## Problem
There is an undirected **star** graph consisting of `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. A star graph is a graph where there is one **center** node and **exactly** `n - 1` edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an edge between the nodes `ui` and `vi`. Return the center of the given star graph.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/24/star_graph.png)

**Input:** edges = [ [1,2],[2,3],[4,2] ]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** edges = [ [1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4] ]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**
- `3 <= n <= 105`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
- `ui != vi`
- The given `edges` represent a valid star graph.

## My solution
For this problem I went the old way and went full way to finding the element that appears `n - 1` times in the edges. For that first I create a map where I will store and keep count the number of times a node appears in the edges. Then I traverse the map and return the one that appears exactly `n - 1` times:

```python
class Solution:
    def findCenter(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        graph_map = defaultdict(int)

        for n1, n2 in edges:
            graph_map[n1] += 1
            graph_map[n2] += 1

        n = len(graph_map)
        for node, val in graph_map.items():
            if val == n - 1:
                return node

        return -1
```

## Most Effective Solution
In this case, there is not gonna be an edge between nodes that are not with the center, so we can just check which node appears two times in the first two edges and return it:

```python
class Solution:
    def findCenter(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        return edges[0][0] if edges[0][0] in edges[1] else edges[0][1]
```
