## Problem
You are given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing **letters** `'X'` and `'O'`, **capture regions** that are **surrounded**:

- **Connect**: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
- **Region**: To form a region **connect every** `'O'` cell.
- **Surround**: The region is surrounded with `'X'` cells if you can **connect the region** with `'X'` cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the `board`.

To capture a **surrounded region**, replace all `'O'`s with `'X'`s **in-place** within the original board. You do not need to return anything.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** board = [ ["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"] ]
**Output:** [ ["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"] ]
**Explanation:**

In the above diagram, the bottom region is not captured because it is on the edge of the board and cannot be surrounded.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** board = [ ["X"] ]
**Output:** [ ["X"] ]

**Constraints:**
- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.

## My Solution
For starters, the `'O'` elements that are at the egde of the board will always be safe, now we just need to check which of the in-center ones are connected to the edge ones. For that we start at the edge and keep a set with visited grid cells and at the end we check which of the regions are not safe and change them to `'X'`:

```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        rows, cols = len(board), len(board[0])
        visit = set()

        def escape(r, c):
            if ((r, c) in visit or r not in range(rows) or c not in range(cols) or board[r][c] == 'X'):
                return
            
            visit.add((r, c))
            escape(r + 1, c)
            escape(r - 1, c)
            escape(r, c + 1)
            escape(r, c - 1)

        for r in range(rows):
            escape(r, 0)
            escape(r, cols - 1)

        for c in range(cols):
            escape(0, c)
            escape(rows - 1, c)

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if board[r][c] == 'O' and (r, c) not in visit:
                    board[r][c] = 'X'
```

I was able to make it a bit faster by getting rid of `visit` and just marking the safe zones as `'T'`:

```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        rows, cols = len(board), len(board[0])

        def escape(r, c):
            if (r not in range(rows) or c not in range(cols) or board[r][c] != 'O'):
                return
            
            board[r][c] = 'T'
            escape(r + 1, c)
            escape(r - 1, c)
            escape(r, c + 1)
            escape(r, c - 1)

        for r in range(rows):
            escape(r, 0)
            escape(r, cols - 1)

        for c in range(cols):
            escape(0, c)
            escape(rows - 1, c)

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if board[r][c] == 'O':
                    board[r][c] = 'X'
                elif board[r][c] == 'T':
                    board[r][c] = 'O'
```
