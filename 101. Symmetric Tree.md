## Problem
Given the `root` of a binary tree, _check whether it is a mirror of itself_ (i.e., symmetric around its center).

**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree1.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree2.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?

## My Solution
The approach used for this problem is a recursive solution. For this problem we need to check if the subtree of left is mirrored to the subtree of right of the root:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def compare(left, right):
            if not left and not right:
                return True

            if not left or not right:
                return False

            if left.val != right.val:
                return False

            return compare(left.left, right.right) and compare(left.right, right.left)

        return compare(root.left, root.right)
```
