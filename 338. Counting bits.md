## Problem
Given an integer `n`, return _an array_ `ans` _of length_ `n + 1` _such that for each_ `i` (`0 <= i <= n`)_,_ `ans[i]` _is the **number of**_ `1`_**'s** in the binary representation of_ `i`.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** [0,1,1]
**Explanation:**
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10

**Example 2:**
**Input:** n = 5
**Output:** [0,1,1,2,1,2]
**Explanation:**
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= n <= 105`

**Follow up:**
- It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of `O(n log n)`. Can you do it in linear time `O(n)` and possibly in a single pass?
- Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like `__builtin_popcount` in C++)?

## Solution - Dynamic programming
For this solution we have to understand that there is a pattern in the way the bits are organized with numbers. So we just need to use that pattern to our benefit.

```python
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        offset = 1

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if offset * 2 == i:
                offset = i
            
            dp[i] = 1 + dp[i - offset]

        return dp
```
