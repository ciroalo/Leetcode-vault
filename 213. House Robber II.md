## Problem
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** nums = [2,3,2]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

**Example 3:**
**Input:** nums = [1,2,3]
**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`


## Solution
It is the same as [[198. House Robber]], the only difference is that it is a circular street. So in this case the easiest thing to do would be to treat them as two different streets. One that goes from `[0, len array - 1]` and another from `[1, end array]`:

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        def robHouse(street):
            rob1 = rob2 = 0

            for house in street:
                temp = max(house + rob1, rob2)
                rob1 = rob2
                rob2 = temp
            
            return rob2
        
        return max(nums[0], robHouse(nums[:-1]), robHouse(nums[1:]))
```

We also cover the edge case where there is only one element in the array.
