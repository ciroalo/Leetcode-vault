## Problem
You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln

_Reorder the list to be on the following form:_

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/04/reorder1linked-list.jpg)

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4]
**Output:** [1,4,2,3]

**Example 2:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/reorder2-linked-list.jpg)

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** [1,5,2,4,3]

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5 * 104]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## My Solution
I have first inserted into a stack all of the nodes, that way I can pop the last element without having to loop through all the nodes to get it. 

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
# def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
# self.val = val
# self.next = next
class Solution:
	def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
		"""
		Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
		"""
		node = output = head
		stack = []
		  
		while node:
			stack.append(node)
		
		node = node.next
		next_node = head.next
		while head:
			next_node = head.next
			node = stack.pop()
			  
			if head == node or next_node == node:
				node.next = None
				return output
			  
			head.next = node
			node.next = next_node
			head = next_node
		  
		next_node.next = None
		return output
```

## Most Effective Solution
The solution can be broken down into three key steps:

### Step 1: Splitting the List into Two Halves

Using the **two-pointer technique**, we can identify the middle of the list:

- `slow` moves one step at a time.
- `fast` moves two steps at a time.

When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be at the midpoint of the list.

Example:

- Input: `1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5`
- After splitting: `1 → 2 → 3` and `4 → 5`

### Step 2: Reversing the Second Half

Next, we reverse the second half of the list. Starting from the node after `slow`, we use a standard iterative reversal process to reverse the pointers.

Example:

- Before reversing: `4 → 5`
- After reversing: `5 → 4`

### Step 3: Merging the Two Halves

Finally, we merge the two halves alternately:

- Take a node from the first half, then a node from the reversed second half.
- Repeat until all nodes are merged.

Example:

- First half: `1 → 2 → 3`
- Reversed second half: `5 → 4`
- Merged: `1 → 5 → 2 → 4 → 3`

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
# def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
# self.val = val
# self.next = next
class Solution:
	def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
		"""
		Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
		"""
		slow = fast = head
		  
		# step 1: find the middle of the list
		while fast and fast.next:
			slow = slow.next
			fast = fast.next.next
		  
		# Step 2: reverse the second list
		second = slow.next
		slow.next = None
		node = None
		  
		while second:
			temp = second.next
			second.next = node
			node = second
			second = temp
		  
		# Step 3: merge the two lists
		first = head
		second = node
		while second:
			temp1, temp2 = first.next, second.next
			first.next, second.next = second, temp1
			first, second = temp1, temp2
```
