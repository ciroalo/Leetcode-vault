## Problem
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
**Output:** "fl"

**Example 2:**
**Input:** strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
**Output:** ""
**Explanation:** There is no common prefix among the input strings.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
- `strs[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters if it is non-empty.

## My Solution
```python
def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
	common = strs[0]
	index = len(common)
	
	for s in strs[1:]:
		i = 0
		while i < index and i < len(s) and s[i] == common[i]:
			i += 1
		
		index = i
		
		if index == 0:
			return ""
	
	return common[:index]
```

I have used a solution that instead of saving the resulting string, i store the position of the index where the returning string ends. That way for bigger arrays it uses less memory.

Because all strings need to have some common denominator, I have used the first string in the array for that purposes and compared it to the other strings.
