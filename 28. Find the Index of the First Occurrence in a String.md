## Problem
Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104`
- `haystack` and `needle` consist of only lowercase English characters.

## My Solution
My first approach didn't work because I was iterating through the list with two pointers, but the problem was that when the match failed, I only reset one of the pointers so for a haystack of "mississipi" and a needle of "issip" because it tried to match before but i didn't update the pointer of the haystack, we would end up missing the match. For that I had to restructure (chatgpt) the code to fix that:

```python
def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
	for i in range(len(haystack) + 1 - len(needle)):
		j = 0
		
		while j < len(needle) and haystack[i + j] == needle[j]:
			j += 1
		if j == len(needle):
			return i
	
	return -1
```
