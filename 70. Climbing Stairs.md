## Problem
You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**
**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

**Example 2:**
**Input:** n = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 45`

## Solution - Memoization
My first approach was to brute force it but it took too much time. Then I followed the idea of memoization from the neetcodes video:

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        stairs_map = defaultdict(int)
        stairs_map[n] = 1

        def climb(target, current):
            if current in stairs_map:
                return stairs_map[current]

            if target < current:
                return 0

            output = climb(target, current + 1)
            output += climb(target, current + 2)

            stairs_map[current] = output
            return output

        return climb(n, 0)
```

## Solution - Dynamic Programming

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        prev = prev_prev = 1

        for i in range(n-1):
            prev, prev_prev = prev + prev_prev, prev
        
        return prev
```
