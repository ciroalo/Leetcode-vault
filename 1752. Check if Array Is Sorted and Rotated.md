## Problem
Given an array `nums`, return `true` _if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated **some** number of positions (including zero)_. Otherwise, return `false`.

There may be **duplicates** in the original array.

**Note:** An array `A` rotated by `x` positions results in an array `B` of the same length such that `B[i] == A[(i+x) % A.length]` for every valid index `i`.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** [1,2,3,4,5] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 2 positions to begin on the element of value 3: [3,4,5,1,2].

**Example 2:**
**Input:** nums = [2,1,3,4]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There is no sorted array once rotated that can make nums.

**Example 3:**
**Input:** nums = [1,2,3]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** [1,2,3] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 0 positions (i.e. no rotation) to make nums.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`


## Solution
For this problem, we can keep count on how many times a number to the right is smaller to the one on the left. For it to be true, it can only be one time, and because its in a cycle, we also have to check the one in the 0-position index and the one at the end:

```python
class Solution:
    def check(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        drops = 0

        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            if nums[i] > nums[i+1]:
                drops += 1

        if nums[0] < nums[-1]:
            drops += 1
        
        return False if drops > 1 else True
```
