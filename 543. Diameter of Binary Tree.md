## Problem
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the length of the **diameter** of the tree_.

The **diameter** of a binary tree is the **length** of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.

The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/diamtree.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

**Example 2:**
**Input:** root = [1,2]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solution

Given the root of a binary tree, return the **length of the diameter** of the tree.  
The diameter of a binary tree is the **length of the longest path** between any two nodes in a tree. This path **may or may not** pass through the root.

- The length of a path is measured by the **number of edges** between nodes.

**KEY IDEAS:**
- The **diameter** at any node is the **sum of the heights** of its left and right subtrees.
- At each node, compute the height of left and right subtrees recursively.
- Update the maximum diameter found so far.

**STEPS:**
1. Use a recursive helper function (`dfs`) to compute the height of each subtree.
2. At each node, calculate `left_height + right_height` and update the answer if it's larger than the previous maximum.
3. Return the height of the current subtree (which is `max(left_height, right_height) + 1`).

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
# def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
# self.val = val
# self.left = left
# self.right = right
class Solution:
	def dfs_height(self, current):
		if not current:
			return 0
		  
		left = self.dfs_height(current.left)
		right = self.dfs_height(current.right)
		  
		self.result = max(self.result, left + right)
		  
		return max(left, right) + 1
		  
	def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
		self.result = 0
		self.dfs_height(root)
		return self.result
```

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(h), where h is the height of the tree (due to the recursion stack).
