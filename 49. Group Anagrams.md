## Problem
Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
**Output:** [ ["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"] ]
**Explanation:**
- There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form `"bat"`.
- The strings `"nat"` and `"tan"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
- The strings `"ate"`, `"eat"`, and `"tea"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** strs = [""]
**Output:** [ [""] ]

**Example 3:**
**Input:** strs = ["a"]
**Output:** [ ["a"] ]

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= strs.length <= 104`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

## My Solution
```python
def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
	grouped = {}
	
	for word in strs:
		sorted_word = "".join(sorted(word))
		if sorted_word in grouped:
			grouped[sorted_word].append(word)
		else:
			grouped[sorted_word] = list()
			grouped[sorted_word].append(word)
	
	anagrams_group = []
	for key, value in grouped.items():
		anagrams_group.append(value)
	  
	return anagrams_group
```

This function groups words that are anagrams of each other from a given list of strings.

The core idea behind the solution is that **anagrams, when sorted alphabetically, produce the same string**. For example, `"eat"`, `"tea"`, and `"ate"` all become `"aet"` when sorted. We use this property to group words.

Here's how the solution works step by step:

1. **Initialize a Dictionary**:  
    I use a dictionary called `grouped` to map each sorted word to a list of its anagrams. The keys in this dictionary are the **sorted versions of the words**, and the values are lists of original words that match that sorted form.
    
2. **Iterate Over Each Word**:  
    For each word in the input list:
    - I sort the word alphabetically using `"".join(sorted(word))`. This sorted string acts as a **hashable representation** that is the same for all anagrams.
    - If this sorted string already exists as a key in the dictionary, I append the original word to the existing list.
    - If it doesn’t exist, I create a new entry with this key and initialize its value with a list containing the current word.
    
3. **Return the Grouped Anagrams**:  
    Finally, I return all the values in the dictionary as a list of lists. Each list contains words that are anagrams of each other.
    

This solution runs in **O(n * k log k)** time, where:
- `n` is the number of words in the input list,
- `k` is the maximum length of a word (because sorting each word takes `O(k log k)`).

It’s efficient and leverages the dictionary (hash map) structure to achieve grouping in a single pass.

## Most Effective Solution
```python
def groupAnagrams(self, strs): 
	anagram_map = defaultdict(list)
	
	for word in strs:
			sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word)) 
			anagram_map[sorted_word].append(word) 
		
	return list(anagram_map.values())
```

Is the same idea but uses different python methods that end up being more efficient.
