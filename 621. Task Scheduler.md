## Problem
You are given an array of CPU `tasks`, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number `n`. Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: there has to be a gap of **at least** `n` intervals between two tasks with the same label.

Return the **minimum** number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
After completing task A, you must wait two intervals before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th interval, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.
With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.

**Example 3:**
**Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.
There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= tasks.length <= 104`
- `tasks[i]` is an uppercase English letter.
- `0 <= n <= 100`

## Solution
### Key Observations
- We want to **schedule tasks with the highest frequency first**, because they are the most restrictive.
- To **minimize idle time**, we want to fill the cooldown intervals (`n`) with other tasks.
- The **maximum frequency of any task** will influence the final answer the most.
### Step-by-step Approach
1. **Count frequency** of each task.
2. **Find the task(s)** with the maximum frequency `max_freq`.
3. Compute how many tasks have this **maximum frequency**.
4. Compute the **ideal minimum length** of the schedule using the formula:

`(minimum_intervals) = (max_freq - 1) * (n + 1) + count_max_freq`

This formula builds `max_freq - 1` full blocks of `(n + 1)` units each (each block includes the most frequent task + cooldown), and adds `count_max_freq` tasks in the last row.

5. The final answer is the **maximum of the total tasks length and the calculated minimum**:

`return max(len(tasks), minimum_intervals)`

This is because if we have enough tasks to fill all idle slots, we don’t need any idles.

```python
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        task_counts = Counter(tasks)
        max_freq = max(task_counts.values())

        count_max_freq = sum(1 for freq in task_counts.values() if freq == max_freq)

        part_count = max_freq - 1
        part_length = n + 1
        minimum_intervals = part_count * part_length + count_max_freq

        return max(len(tasks), minimum_intervals)
```

## Heap Priority Queue Solution
### Intuition
The heap-based approach simulates **actual scheduling**:
- We use a **max heap** to always pick the task with the highest remaining frequency.
- We simulate time units step-by-step.
- If a task is executed, it's pushed back into the heap (if it has remaining instances).
- A cooldown queue helps track when a task can be pushed back to the heap.

This is more **simulation-based**, compared to the formulaic greedy method.

### Algorithm Steps
1. Count the frequency of each task.
2. Use a **max heap** (use negatives because Python has min-heap by default).
3. Use a **cooldown queue** (FIFO) to store tasks during their cooldown, with a timestamp of when they can re-enter the heap
4. For every time unit:
    - If the heap is not empty, pop the task with the highest count.
    - Execute it (reduce its count), and if it’s not finished, put it in the cooldown queue.
    - Check if any tasks in the cooldown queue are ready to go back into the heap.
    - Increment time.

```python
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        task_counts = Counter(tasks)

        max_heap = [-cnt for cnt in task_counts.values()]
        heapq.heapify(max_heap)

        cooldown = deque()
        time = 0

        while max_heap or cooldown:
            time += 1
            
            if max_heap:
                count = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
                count += 1
                if count < 0:
                    cooldown.append((time + n, count))
        
            if cooldown and cooldown[0][0] == time:
                _, task_ready = cooldown.popleft()
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, task_ready)
        
        return time
```
