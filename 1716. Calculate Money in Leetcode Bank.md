## Problem
Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank **every day**.

He starts by putting in `$1` on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in `$1` more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in `$1` more than the **previous Monday**.

Given `n`, return _the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the_ `nth` _day._

**Example 1:**
**Input:** n = 4
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** n = 10
**Output:** 37
**Explanation:** After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.

**Example 3:**
**Input:** n = 20
**Output:** 96
**Explanation:** After the 20th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) + (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) = 96.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 1000`

## Solution
For this type of math problem, its always better to visualise how it works, for that I am gonna create a table with what Hercy adds to his bank account:

| 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   |
| 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   |
| 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | -   | -   | -   |

In this example we would end up going `25` times to the bank. From this we can infer a lot of things. The first one is that there is the `base` case, and that would be the first week with a total value of *28*. And the following week is the same value as the previous week plus *7* more. And with that we have the values of the full weeks, now we are left to understand what he deposits in his bank in the `days left`. 

In his `days left` he will deposit the first Monday the value of the current week we are in, with an increment of 1 per day till we reach the last day.

We could code this with loops for better understanding, but I've decided for a math approach this time.

First, we use the following formula to get the value for the full weeks:

$$\mathrm{base} = \sum_{i=1}^{7} i = 28 $$
$$\mathrm{balance_fullWeeks} = (base * N) + 7 * \sum_{i=1}^{N} i = (base * N) + 7 * \dfrac {N * (N + 1)}{2}$$

Then we use the next one to get the value for the days left:

$$\mathrm{balance_daysLeft} = \sum_{i = 0}^{s-1} (k + i) =  \dfrac{(s(2k + s - 1))}{2}$$

Then to get the total balance we just need to do:

$$\mathrm{balance} = \mathrm{balance_fullWeeks} + \mathrm{balance_daysLeft} $$


```python
class Solution:
    def totalMoney(self, n: int) -> int:
        balance = 0
        days_week = 7

        base_case = int((days_week * (days_week + 1)) / 2)
        index = n // days_week
        days_left = n % days_week

        # add the full weeks
        balance = int((base_case * index)+(days_week * index * (index - 1) / 2))
        # add the days left
        balance += int((days_left * (2 * (index + 1) + days_left - 1)) / 2)

        return balance
```
