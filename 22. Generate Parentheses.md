## Problem
Given `n` pairs of parentheses, write a function to _generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses_.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** n = 3
**Output:** ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]

**Example 2:**
**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** ["()"]

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 8`

## My Solution
```python
class Solution:
	def tryParenthesis(self, n: int, op: int, cl: int, comb: str, output: List[str]):
		if op < cl or op > n:
			return
		
		self.tryParenthesis(n, op + 1, cl, comb + "(", output)
		self.tryParenthesis(n, op, cl + 1, comb + ")", output)
		
		if op == n and cl == n:
			output.append(comb)
	
	def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
		output = []
		self.tryParenthesis(n, 1, 0, '(', output)
		return output
```

They are asking us to generate all possible valid combinations of parenthesis of `n` pairs. In this solution I have used a `recursive` function where if the closing parenthesis are more of there is more open parenthesis than `n`, that branch stops. Then we try a new combination with the left parenthesis and then another with the right.

One way to make it more efficient (should see) and more pretty is to make the `tryParenthesis` method inside the `generateParenthesis` method. That way we don't have to pass the `n` value nor the `output` list. So we should have less memory in the stack.

And apparently it doesn't. While it is still pretty efficient, it seems the way python manages  inside methods its not as effective as normal class methods:
